                                "It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness." - Eleanor Roosevelt.

                                Do you ever think you can get inspiration from

                                any object or everything around you, even from

                                a candle or a Rubik cube?

                                This book gives a very optimistic approach to

                                saw natural elements or different objects, and

                                it tells us how we can learn from them.

                                This book changes my perspective to look at these materialistic things and gives me a
                                fresh direction to move forward in life. Nilshree explained very beautifully what we can
                                learn from nature and objects around us. This simple yet practical approach helps us
                                deal with the daily problems of life. This book can be read by anyone irrespective

                                of age and teaches us some life lessons along

                                the way.

                                Thank you so much Nilshree Damani Yelulkar for sharing your book with me, just love it.

                                every object and the lessons that we should

                                learn and teach our kids too..

                                A new subject and the way to write is very simple. A lightweight book that speaks about
                                how we are connected to this world and the world that is connected to us. A great book
                                written by my friend Nilashree. First of all, best wishes for this success and may you
                                be inspired to write more.

                                This book has a total of 53 points to which we can connect ourselves to ourselves and
                                every element around us. Nature is made up of the five Mahabhutas and we, too, have

                                My review goes to Nilshree Damani Yelulkar for her book "Object+lf=1"

                                It is such an amazing book. Small little everyday things we look at can be so inspiring.
                                After reading this book I have gained a new perspective all together. Now whenever I
                                look at any object near me I keep wondering what exactly is this object trying to tell
                                me. Also the vocabulary used for writing this amazing piece is so reader friendly that
                                even children can read it and understand it.

                                And once I finished the book, my mom in law picked it up just to see what I was reading
                                for so many days and now for past half an hour she is glued to the book.

                                Loved it.. You would expect if 27 females write a book, it would be feminist. But it's
                                not. I liked how the author has tried to bring life to the lost art of writing letters.
                                Some letters are emotional though some are simply funny. Worth giving a read. Especially
                                I would suggest parents to make their children read this. Good for their emotional
                                growth and vocabulary.

                                This is a not just a collection of letters, but a bouquet of emotions that every reader
                                can relate to. I enjoyed reading each one of them because all are so unique, vivid,
                                varied, and vibrant in emotions. Highly recommended and a must-read for every one.

                                This was amazing! Letters of hope and letters of love... Letters to Enid Blyton and
                                Letters to parents children, this book is a true bouquet of emotions! Loved many, but my
                                fav was the letter by 18year old Akshita, wise beyond her years. Loved it!
